## Introduction

When LGBTQ people talk about community, does what they mean invoke a _gemeinschaftliche_, belonging- and social organization-oriented sense of the concept? Do they invoke _Gemeinschaft_ to a greater extent than in more general and generic contexts? In answering these questions, this chapter responds, in part, to a call from @levine_paradox_2017 to investigate the power and ambiguity of "community" in contexts other than his own, where he shows how it operates as a rationale in the case of local governance; it also responds to a host of LGBTQ research that sometimes problematizes community [@orne_boystown_2017; @winer_solidarity_2020] and sometimes takes it for granted [@frost_measuring_2012]. I demonstrate how the empirical everyday meaning of "community" in an LGBTQ social context invokes sociological understandings of _Gemeinschaft_, of community as a meso-level form of social organization [@tonnies_community_2001; @brint_gemeinschaft_2001] -- albeit not exclusively. This evident salience of Gemeinschaft matters given the prevailing view of modern, urban society as instead promoting individualism and isolation
[@simmel_metropolis_1971; @putnam_bowling_2001], and how those individualistic trends have been intertwined with the historical development of LGBTQ identities [@demilio_capitalism_1992].

To approach the question of how salient community as Gemeinschaft is for LGBTQ people, I examine how the concept of "community" shows up in one LGBTQ-centered social group. Founded in 1983, a Usenet group called soc.motss ("soc" meaning one of the many groups for social discussion, and motss standing for "members of the same sex") is the earliest known virtual community built around a shared LGBTQ identity [@auerbach_first_2014]. This makes it unique and important, because it sets a precedent and influences how later online groups become ubiquitous fora for discussing community, identity, and many other topics [@dym_coming_2019]. The data I use from soc.motss are an archived corpus of individual messages sent to the group from the late 1990s through the 2000s. For a comparative baseline, I draw on a large volume of Internet text, not directly, but mediated through an off-the-shelf natural language processing (NLP) model. This baseline represents general or generic contemporary English-language discourse.

TODO: why virtual? => reasons Kate says [what were those reasons?]

This chapter adopts innovative NLP methods to learn about community from how the word is used in naturally-occurring language. I systematically investigate the connotations of community across text using word embeddings [@mikolov_efficient_2013] -- a type of model that mathematically represents words based on the contexts in which they appear. Word embeddings are well-suited for investigating the semantic dimensions of social concepts and how they vary across contexts because -- unlike other methods for computational text analysis -- they move from surface-level words to underlying meanings and their relations [@stoltz_cultural_2021; @arseniev-koehler_machine_2022]. By first engaging in a close read of how "community" is represented in a general word embeddings model pretrained on large amounts of online text (approximating a generic social context), I lay the foundation for interrogating how the meaning of "community" in the context of soc.motss differs from that generic context, and how it remains similar. Specifically, I use dimensionality reduction and algebraic transformations to assess how related "community" is to three latent semantic dimensions -- geography, Gemeinschaft, identity -- in each of those contexts.

I hypothesize that, in a self-selected virtual community based on LGBTQ identity, if community itself is salient as a topic, then members will visibly talk about community as Gemeinschaft. If, by contrast, community is backgrounded and ambient, other senses of the word will be more evident in the localized embedding of the term. What I find is that the discourse in the soc.motss LGBTQ Usenet group uses community in the sense of Gemeinschaft to at least an equal extent compared with general English-language text. The key semantic difference is that it also deemphasizes the geographic aspects of community and replaces that with connotations specific to LGBTQ identities. In other words, I show that "community" in the general sense brings together two semantic domains -- geography and Gemeinschaft; in a queer context the geographic connotation recedes to the background and a third domain, identity, emerges to take precedence. Community in the sense of Gemeinschaft turns out to be the common bridge between the general and LGBTQ-specific contexts.

## Background

I can keep a lot of the background because why the fuck not. the main section that needs elaboration is the one about the context of Usenet, which I've started to jot down.

talk about the time period

context: heels of DOMA and DADT, through to 2004 referenda; early end of a two-decade-long shift in public opinion and change in the legal landscape (from lawrence v texas in 2003 to obergefell v hodges in 2015); decriminalizing same-sex sexual relations , legalizing same-sex marriage

who uses usenet? self-selected group; described as more introverted, so might not have had as much access to or comfort in LGBTQ spaces like gay bars [auerbach]; again this was before everyone was on social media; outlet for outsider-ness [boyd]. (probably disproportionately concentrated in tech/gay centers like the Bay Area, as were other virtual communities of the time [rheingold])

## Data and methods

some confusing bits here apparently. I think I just need to answer kate's questions and move on.



## Results

defend my fucking choices because they are good choices and I'm not changing them. most work to do here I suspect





## Discussion

Kate liked this part for the most part.
